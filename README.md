# Bank-Customer-Churn-Model
Internship project
. Data Preprocessing ðŸ”Ž and Exploratory Data Analysis ðŸ’¡ (EDA):
To ensure the quality and reliability of the data, extensive preprocessing and EDA were performed. Missing values were imputed or removed, outliers were handled appropriately, and feature engineering techniques were applied to extract meaningful patterns.

2.Feature Selection and Engineering ðŸ–Š :
Feature selection was conducted to reduce dimensionality and enhance model interpretability.

3.Addressing Class Imbalance â›” :
Churn datasets often suffer from class imbalance, with a significantly larger number of non-churned customers compared to churned ones. To address this issue, we employed techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) .

4.Hyperparameter Tuning ðŸ”® and Model Deployment:
Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the model's performance, ensuring the best combination of parameters for each algorithm. The final model was then deployed in a production environment, allowing the bank to make real-time predictions and take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.

5.Continuous Monitoring ðŸ–¥ and Model Maintenance:
A robust model monitoring and maintenance strategy were put in place to ensure its continued accuracy and effectiveness. Regular updates were made to accommodate changes in customer behavior and business dynamics, keeping the model up-to-date and relevant.

6. Impact and Future Work: ðŸ’Ž
The Bank Customer Churn Model developed during my internship at YBI Foundation has had a profound impact on the bank's customer retention efforts. By predicting churn in advance and implementing targeted retention strategies, the bank has been able to reduce customer attrition significantly, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and increased revenue.
